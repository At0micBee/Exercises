# Python exercises


This repository compiles some exercises that I have prepared to teach Python to students in a scientific field (mathematics, physics, engineering, ...). A prior understanding of a programming language is not particularly required, but a foundation of both math and physics is highly recommended. Note that this repository only presents the problems and their solutions, the courses given in parallel aren't uploaded here.

The exercises are mostly directed towards physics and data processing and analysis; namely:

- File reading / writing
- Plotting and visualization
- Statistics and mathematical analysis

## Resources

The [learn python](learnpython.org) website has many exercises and guided tutorial on both basics and advanced concepts.

The W3School website has a dedicated section on [learning python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), with examples and exercises.

A good intermediary level book is [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/), from O'Reilly publishing.

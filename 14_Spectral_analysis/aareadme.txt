This data set presents a list of 12,219 identified and 4,055 unidentified     
spectral lines found in high-resolution spectra of Comet 122P/deVico.         
The wavelength range covered is 3830-10192 Angstroms.  Coverage is            
continuous in the range 3830-5776 Angstroms, with increasing inter-order      
gaps over the range577-10192 Angstroms.                                       
                                                                              
The data tables listing the identified and unidentified lines are in          
the "data/" subdirectory in the form of ASCII tables, which can be            
used to generate plots.                                                       
                                                                              
For the convenience of users, plots of these lines in several different       
formats are supplied in the "document/" subdirectory.  See the                
"docinfo.txt" file in that subdirectory for information about the             
context and identification plots provided.
